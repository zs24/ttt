   <!--   3/10/99 It seemed that the Monoject syringes were really narrower -->
   <!--   long infusions failed to deliver the proper volume. -->
   <!--  Margaret Der contacted Monoject: -->
   <!--   The rep. for the Monoject syringes just called (after several more phone -->
   <!--   messages) and said the diameter for the 20 cc Monoject syringe was 0.787 -->
   <!--    inches.  This calculates to 19.98 mm. -->
   <!--      Harvard pumps published number is 20.4 mm -->
   <!--  In tracking the first 16 NH3 doses in 1999, the desired dose was 5 mCi, and -->
   <!--   the calculated delivered dose was 5.01 +/- .16 -->
   <!--   "Correcting" the diameter to 19.98 would increase the delivery by -->
   <!--   (20.4/19.98)#2 or  4 % or from 5.0 to 5.2 mCi -->
   <!--  Somewhere in this measurement system we are making some errors. We are -->
   <!--   specifying the deadspace as 0.5 ml when it is at least 0.6 ml. We are also -->
   <!--   post-counting a large portion of the activity for the 5 mCi injections. -->
   <!--  Therefore, we will continue to use the WRONG diameter, so that the final -->
   <!--   delivered dose remains correct. -->
