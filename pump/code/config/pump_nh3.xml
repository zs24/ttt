   <!--  2003-12-10 RC - During 2003, the average dose administered for 5 mCi -->
   <!--     desired was 5.3 mCi. It was 5.2 in early 2003 when the average delivered dose -->
   <!--     from the cyclotron was 16 mCi and increased to 5.4 from May to Dec 03 -->
   <!--      when the average cyclotron delivery was 24 mCi. This bias is a problem -->
   <!--      because in the process of measuring, there will be some variability, -->
   <!--      so occasionally we will appear to over-dose by 10% ( greater than  5.5). This bias can be explained -->
   <!--      by a small discrepancy between the cyclotron Capintec and the one in the -->
   <!--      radiopharmacy, i.e., if the cyclotron Capintec reads 2% higher then the one -->
   <!--      in the radiopharmacy, that can explain it. For example, if the amount in the -->
   <!--       syringe at injection time is 20 mCi, the redisual (decay corrected to  injection -->
   <!--      time should be 15, i.e., 20-15 = 5. If the 20, measured in the cyclotron, reads -->
   <!--      high by 2 %, then 20*(1+.02) - 15 = 5.4.  We are doing 2 things to alleviate this problem. -->
   <!--      First, I sent email to Mike Channing to remind the appropriate staff to only send up 15 -->
   <!--      mCi for the 5 mCi doses - that reduces the expected error, but there should still be -->
   <!--      an apparent overdose if there is this 2% difference in the Capintecs. Therefore, I -->
   <!--      am  increasing the diameter value that the pump is told. By increasing this value -->
   <!--      by 1%, the cross sectional area increases by 2%, and the pump will slow down its pusher -->
   <!--      arm by 2%. This will account for the apparent 2% higher measurement of the cyclotron -->
   <!--      Capintec compared to the radiopharmacy one -->
   <!--  2001-05-02 R C - Since early April 2001, suddenly 5 mCi doses are low- -->
   <!--      3.5-4 mCi instead of ~ 5 mCi. Cannot find good explanation. -->
   <!--      Cyclotron will now deliver less activity (~15 mCi)  so inject a -->
   <!--      bigger fraction and post-counts are lower.  So, we will now stop -->
   <!--      lying to the pump program, i.e., will say 0.6 ml deadspace and -->
   <!--      say diameter is 19.98 mm, not 20.4 -->

   <!--  -->
   <!--   3/10/99 It seemed that the Monoject syringes were really narrower -->
   <!--   long infusions failed to deliver the proper volume. -->
   <!--  Margaret Der contacted Monoject -->
   <!--   The rep. for the Monoject syringes just called (after several more phone -->
   <!--   messages) and said the diameter for the 20 cc Monoject syringe was 0.787 -->
   <!--    inches.  This calculates to 19.98 mm. -->
   <!--      Harvard pumps published number is 20.4 mm -->
   <!--  In tracking the first 16 NH3 doses in 1999, the desired dose was 5 mCi, and -->
   <!--   the calculated delivered dose was 5.01 +/- .16 -->
   <!--   "Correcting" the diameter to 19.98 would increase the delivery by -->
   <!--   (20.4/19.98)#2 or  4 % or from 5.0 to 5.2 mCi -->
   <!--  Somewhere in this measurement system we are making some errors. We are -->
   <!--   specifying the deadspace as 0.5 ml when it is at least 0.6 ml. We are also -->
   <!--   post-counting a large portion of the activity for the 5 mCi injections. -->
   <!--  Therefore, we will continue to use the WRONG diameter, so that the final -->
   <!--   delivered dose remains correct. -->
